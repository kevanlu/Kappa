Kappa
=====

Kappa is a Curvature Analysis Program developed in Java, aimed towards measuring the curvature in biological images. It allows a user to trace an initial shape with a B-Spline curve, and then fit that curve to image data with a minimization algorithm. Kappa was written with the Swing widget toolkit, and has been tested thoroughly on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.

Compiling the Source Code
-------------------------
### Importing the Project into Eclipse with eGit
eGit allows you to work with Git repositories within the Eclipse IDE. To add Kappa as an Eclipse project using eGit, perform the following steps:

1. Install eGit by following the instructions found here: http://www.eclipse.org/egit/
2. From the Eclipse Menubar, go to File -> Import
3. From the list of input sources, choose 'Projects from Git'
4. Choose 'URL' as the Repository Source
5. Fill out the fields as follows: 
	1. The host is 'github.com'
	2. The repository path is '/kevanlu/Kappa'
	3. The Protocol is 'git'
6. Press next, choose the master branch, and choose the local destination for the project.

### Compiling Kappa without Eclipse
If you do not want to use Eclipse or eGit to work on the project, you can compile Kappa from the command line. A compile script is provided in the main directory of the program folder. It requires the build tool **Apache Ant** to be installed. If Ant is present, then compiling the project is straightforward.

#### In Mac OS X or Linux
After extracting the downloaded archive, open a Terminal/Shell window, and navigate to the folder. Run compile.sh with the following command:

	./compile.sh Kappa

Note that in **OS X Mavericks**, ant is not installed by default. It can be installed using Homebrew with the following commands:

	ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
	brew install https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/master/ant.rb

#### In Windows
Windows cannot natively run the compile script, but can do so with **Cygwin** installed (www.cygwin.com). Once Cygwin is installed, you can open a Cygwin terminal window, and follow the same steps as with a Mac OS X or Linux installation.
