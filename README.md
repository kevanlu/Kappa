Kappa
=====

Kappa is a Curvature Analysis Program developed in Java, aimed towards measuring the curvature in biological images. It allows a user to trace an initial shape with a B-Spline curve, and then fit that curve to image data with a minimization algorithm. Kappa was written with the Swing widget toolkit, and has been tested thoroughly on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
